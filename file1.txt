In this third episode of the 'Planet Hoola' Science Fiction Romance series, author Sudipta Das traces the evolutionary path of the ascent of the alien Hoo race, on a far away planet. In this work, the author has wonderfully combined the entire spectrum, from Physics to Metaphysics, and merged poetry into prose to intriguingly illustrate the Big Picture.

His realisations are telling and connect easily. A celestial comet is horrendously hurled towards Hoola, on a direct collision course. The collision could potentially wipe out all life on the uniquely colourful planet, including the technologically advanced Hoos.

The impending calamity notwithstanding, the Hoos find themselves faced with yet another predicament that creeps up from within themselves. Meanwhile, silently blossoms love. Will the Hoos come around to overcome both the external and the internal obstacles that threaten their very existence? Or will they crumble under the weight of their own spectacular and vibrant, but often divisive, diversity?
